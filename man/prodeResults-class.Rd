\description{
\code{prodeResults} class is an object which extends DataFrame
object (reporting results of PRODE run), by including \code{adjMatrix} as the
adjacency matrix resulting after PRODE run (in case some genes have been filtered out) and

out during the analyisis (depending on the analyses settings).
