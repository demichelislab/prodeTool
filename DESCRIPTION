Description: The prodeTool package implements PRODE, an analysis workflow that integrates Gene Effects data and Protein-Protein
    Interactions to compute per-gene, Neighborhood-Informed Essential (NIE) and Neighborhood-Informed Context Essential (NICE) scores.NIE and NICE scores are computed through a rank-based approach where average Gene Effects (across multiple samples) or Differential Gene Effects (between two groups of samples) are combined at gene-level and neighborhood level. The resulting NIE and NICE scores can be leveraged as essentiality or context-essentiality measures for genes prioritization purposes. The more negative the scores, the better the signal.
